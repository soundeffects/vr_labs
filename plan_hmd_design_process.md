# Plan: The Process of Designing the HMD
First step is to outline the constraints:
- Weight under 100g (lower is better)
- Cost under $3000, but generally not an issue (design a
premium market product)
- Outline components required
- horizontal and vertical FoV >120 degrees (more is better)
- Distortion tolerance needs to be researched
- Resolution per eye ~1000x1000
- Head geometry less than two inches out from head
- Should look cool
- Eye-following mechanics should be under 20ms of latency
- Motors/actuators should be whisper-quiet
